# Changelog

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 6c71e4d: Handle malformed MCP config files gracefully during `ctx7 remove` agent detection. Previously, an unparseable JSON config at any agent's well-known path (e.g. a hand-edited `~/.claude.json`) would crash the command with an unhandled `SyntaxError` before it could do anything. The detector now skips the offending file and logs a warning naming the path and parse error so the user can fix it, while detection continues for the remaining agents.
- 4056850: Respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var when resolving Claude Code's global config, rules, skills, and detection paths

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 1aa3430: Remove research mode entirely from the MCP server and CLI. The `query-docs` MCP tool no longer accepts or forwards a `researchMode` parameter, and the CLI no longer exposes a `--research` flag on `ctx7 docs`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 17b864f: Expose research mode through the MCP `researchMode` tool and the CLI `docs --research` flag for deep, agent-driven documentation answers.

### Patch Changes

- 4feee15: Add CLI update notifications and a new `ctx7 upgrade` command. The CLI now checks for newer versions with cached state, shows a non-blocking notice before interactive commands, and provides safer upgrade guidance across npm, pnpm, bun, and ephemeral runner setups.
- f056b14: Add `ctx7 remove` as the cleanup counterpart to `ctx7 setup`, with safer detection and removal behavior. The command now prompts only for agents with actual Context7 artifacts, preserves non-Context7 MCP configuration when removing entries, and includes stronger test coverage for JSON and TOML cleanup.

## 0.3.13

### Patch Changes

- 3f6e310: Fix skill installation path validation on Windows so valid files inside the target directory are not rejected due to backslash-separated resolved paths.

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- 33f2338: Add Codex-specific CLI setup guidance so generated rules and the installed `find-docs` skill tell Codex to rerun Context7 CLI requests outside the default sandbox after DNS or network failures.

## 0.3.11

### Patch Changes

- bc8eaf1: Add `--all-agents` and `--yes` support to `ctx7 skills install` for non-interactive multi-agent installs.

## 0.3.10

### Patch Changes

- fb29170: Add Gemini CLI support to setup command
- 89d4862: Use GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN or gh CLI auth for skill downloads to avoid GitHub API rate limits and support private repos
- 8322879: Improve resolve libryar id tool prompt to provide the libraryName query with proper format

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- 6961bdd: Allow re-selecting already configured agents in ctx7 setup and overwrite existing MCP config entries instead of skipping them. Fix TOML replacement to correctly handle sub-sections and prevent whitespace drift on repeated runs.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- a667712: Update search filter warning
- d739f9b: Fix OpenCode MCP setup to resolve all config file variants (opencode.json, opencode.jsonc, .opencode.json, .opencode.jsonc)
- 4f13168: Install rules alongside skills in `ctx7 setup` for better trigger rates
  - CLI setup now installs a rule file for each agent (previously only installed the skill)
  - Rule content fetched from GitHub, with agent-specific formatting (alwaysApply for Cursor)
  - Updated find-docs skill description for higher invocation rates (66% -> 98%)
  - Added Codex agent support with AGENTS.md append
  - OpenCode now writes to AGENTS.md instead of .opencode/rules/
  - Selective rule content with explicit when-to-use/when-not-to-use guidance

- c3c2647: Use ~/.agents/skills instead of ~/.config/agents/skills for global universal skill installs

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- 93eaf54: Remove shell:true from spawn call in generate command to prevent command injection via EDITOR env variable
- 8c5cf7d: Prevent directory traversal in skill file installation by validating resolved paths stay within the target directory

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- fae6127: Add active teamspace name to whoami command output
- 4b63117: Reorder setup mode choices to show MCP server first
- 18b3292: Add token refresh support, centralize auth constants, switch whoami to internal API endpoint with teamspace display, and add unit tests for CLI auth utilities and commands

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 7e60d05: - feat(cli): track install count events when skills are installed via `ctx7 setup`

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 62dc278: - feat(cli): enumerate popularity with a 4-star scale in skill search, install, and suggest results
  - feat(cli): show install count range and trust score in skill hover details
  - fix(cli): rename "docs" skill to "find-docs" in setup output and prompts
- 04130b5: Consolidate skills under /skills with canonical sources: rename docs→find-docs, ctx7-cli→context7-cli, add context7-mcp as canonical MCP skill. MCP setup now downloads skill from GitHub instead of using hardcoded content.
- d418405: Add CLI mode to ctx7 setup for installing the docs skill without MCP configuration

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 31b4fb8: Align CLI library output format with MCP: use labeled fields (Title, Context7-compatible library ID, Description, Code Snippets, Source Reputation, Benchmark Score, Versions) and categorical reputation labels (High/Medium/Low/Unknown) instead of numeric trust scores
- 9de3f06: Display warning when public library access filter is being used to filter libraries.
- 05a4406: Remove default selection of Universal agent target during skills install prompt
- 9aae852: Show source repository next to skill name in search and suggest results for easier disambiguation

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 6328ed1: Skill search & generate command improvements:
  - Add "Installs" and "Trust(0-10)" columns to skill search results with aligned column headers
  - Auto-login via OAuth when the generate command requires authentication instead of showing an error
  - Reorder question options so the recommended choice always appears first with a "✓ Recommended" badge
